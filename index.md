# 🧬 Cancer Cell Line Drug Resistance Analysis

Welcome to my final academic project for the **Advanced Diploma in Biotechnology**.  
This work focuses on analyzing gene expression data from breast cancer cell lines that developed resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Two MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell lines were exposed to increasing doses of:
- **Paclitaxel (Taxol™)**
- **Doxorubicin (Adriamycin™)**

The goal:  
🧪 **Identify genes associated with drug resistance** by analyzing microarray data from six escalating drug doses (Doses 7–12).

## 💼 Skills Demonstrated

- 🔬 Microarray analysis using TMEV
- 📊 Differential gene expression workflows
- 🧠 Bioinformatics interpretation via GeneCards
- 🧾 Scientific reporting and visualization

---

## 📈 Key Results

### Paclitaxel-Resistant Cell Line:
- 🟢 Upregulated: `ABCB1`, `TUBB3`
- 🔴 Downregulated: `CDKN1A`

### Doxorubicin-Resistant Cell Line:
- 🟢 Upregulated: `TOP2A`, `GSTM1`
- 🔴 Downregulated: `TP53`

These changes suggest mechanisms like:
- Drug efflux transporters
- Microtubule remodeling
- Oxidative stress defense
- Apoptosis resistance
