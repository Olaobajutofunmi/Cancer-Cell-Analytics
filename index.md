# 🧬 Cancer Cell Line Drug Resistance Analysis

Welcome to my final academic project for the Advanced Diploma in Biotechnology. This project explores transcriptomic changes in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) using microarray data.

## 📘 Project Summary
Two derivative MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell lines were exposed to Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin, leading to acquired resistance. By analyzing the changes in gene expression at various drug doses, I identified genetic signatures associated with resistance.

## 💻 Skills Demonstrated
- **Gene Expression & Array Analysis** using `.mev` data files.
- **Differential Gene Expression** via multiple statistical approaches.
- **Biological Interpretation** using GeneCards and other bioinformatics tools.
- **Scientific Reporting** including structured summaries, visuals, and citations.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Paclitaxel Resistance Genes**: Upregulation of *ABCB1*, *TUBB3*, etc.
- **Doxorubicin Resistance Genes**: Upregulation of *TOP2A*, *GSTM1*, etc.
- Resistance linked to mechanisms like drug efflux, altered apoptosis, and oxidative stress response.
