# 🧬 Analysis of Drug-Resistant Breast Cancer Cell Line Data

## 📘 Project Overview
This project represents the final academic assessment for my Advanced Diploma in Biotechnology. It involves the analysis of gene expression data derived from drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7). Two separate cell lines were exposed to chemotherapeutic agents—Paclitaxel (Taxol™) and Adriamycin (Doxorubicin™)—to induce resistance. Using transcriptomic data, I identified gene expression signatures that correlate with the development of drug resistance.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore the molecular basis of resistance in breast cancer cell lines.
- Determine up- and down-regulated genes involved in resistance using array expression analysis.
- Interpret biological relevance of these genes using bioinformatics tools such as GeneCards.

## 🧪 Biological Background
MCF-7 is a widely studied breast adenocarcinoma cell line. Paclitaxel acts by stabilizing microtubules, preventing cell division, while Doxorubicin intercalates into DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, leading to apoptosis. Over time, both drugs induce cellular resistance mechanisms that alter gene expression profiles.
